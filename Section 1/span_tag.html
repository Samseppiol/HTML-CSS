    <h1> Hey there.</h1>

    <!--Similar to a div tag however this will not create a new line.  -->
    <!-- <span> My amazing content </span> -->

    <div>
      My first type of content goes here.
      <div>
        My second type of content goes here.
        <div>
          <!--This is how we properly use a span tag, with CSS to show its importance.  -->
          <!--We can't use a div for this because it will create a new line and separate our input, we only wanted to change the styling for a few words
          and leave it on the same line  -->
          My third <span style="color: red;">type of content</span> goes here
        </div>
      </div>
