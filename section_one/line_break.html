      <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br> industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br> It was popularised in the
        1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
         with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
