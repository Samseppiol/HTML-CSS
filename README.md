Uploading html and css stuff to github... cringeworthy I know but I want to keep track of my work and my progress. Also with the last udemy course I just finished on ruby, I uploaded all of those files as well
and I found they were a far better 'go back to' reference, being able to read my commits than searching
through a file directory looking for the example.

I have also started to bounce between my macbook pro and my ubuntu tower, and just using git pull to keep each machine up to date with each other which I think is fantastic
