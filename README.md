HTML/CSS Bootcamp course on Udemy by Jordan Hudgens


UPDATE: 12 MAR 2017
Have just finished all of the html and css exercises, some of it was very valuable and interesting and some of it
was like pulling teeth, however now we are up to the exciting stuff! The projects. We will be recreating the google homepage, the pinterest homepage and the tesla homepage.



Uploading html and css stuff to github... cringeworthy I know but I want to keep track of my work and my progress. Also with the last udemy course I just finished on ruby, I uploaded all of those files as well
and I found they were a far better 'go back to' reference, being able to read my commits than searching
through a file directory looking for the example.

I have also started to bounce between my macbook pro and my ubuntu tower, and just using git pull to keep each machine up to date with each other which I think is fantastic
